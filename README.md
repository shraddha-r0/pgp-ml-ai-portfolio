# 🧠 Data Science Portfolio – PGP Projects

Welcome! This repository showcases a series of six hands-on projects developed as part of my academic training in data science and machine learning in the PGP AI and ML Program with UT Austin and Great Learning. Each folder contains a self-contained Jupyter notebook focused on a specific concept or application.

Below is an overview of the contents:

---

## 📊 Project 1 – FoodHub - Exploratory Data Analysis

*Course: Python Foundations*

Perform an **exploratory data analysis** and provide actionable insights for a food aggregator company to get a fair idea about the demand of different restaurants and cuisines, which will help them enhance their customer experience and improve the business

---

## 🌲 Project 2 – Personal Loan Campaign - Decision Tree

*Course: Machine Learning*

To identify bank customers with a high likelihood of purchasing a loan, you need to analyze the provided data to understand key customer attributes influencing loan acquisition. With this analysis, build **a predictive model that captures patterns and customer characteristics**, which will help the bank effectively target potential loan buyers, improving marketing efforts and increasing conversion rates.

## 📉 Project 3 – Churn Prediction - Ensemble Methods

*Course: Advanced Machine Learning*

Analyze the data and come up with a predictive model to determine if a customer will leave the credit card services or not and the reason behind it

---

## 🧠 Project 4 – Churn Prediction - Neural Networks
*Course: Introduction to Neural Networks*

Analyze the customer data, build a **neural network** to help the operations team identify the customers that are more likely to churn, and provide recommendations on how to retain such customers

---

## 👁️ Project 5 – Seedling Classification - Computer Vision
*Course: Introduction to Computer Vision*

Build a robust image classifier using **convolutional neural networks** to efficiently classify different plant seedlings and weeds to improve crop yields and minimize human involvement

---

## 💬 Project 6 – Stock Market News Sentiment Analysis and Summarization - Natural Language Processing 
*Course: Introduction to Natural Language Processing*

Develop an an AI-driven sentiment analysis system that will automatically process and analyze news articles to gauge market sentiment, and summarize the news at a weekly level to enhance the accuracy of their stock price predictions and optimize investment strategies.

### 📌 Notes:
- All projects follow clean coding practices, include inline explanations, and use standard libraries (`scikit-learn`, `keras`, `seaborn`, etc.).
- Each notebook is designed to be understandable and reproducible.
